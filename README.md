Microservice A Random Event Generator

**Instructions**

**Requesting Data**
The program will request user input from the UI.py file. Then it will wait and request the .txt file that is eventually sent to the writeEvent.txt

**Recieving Data**
After recieving data from the user, it will then send it to the event.txt file. It will also recieve a random number from the randomNum.py, it will use that random number that is saved in the randomNumber.py file to choose the text file that corresponds with that number in the user input file. The program then recieves this text file, and prints out what is written inside the .txt file.
